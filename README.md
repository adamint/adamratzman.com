This repo contains the TypeScript source for my portfolio site, created using TS and React.

To run this site, ensure that you have `yarn` and `node.js` installed. Then, run `yarn start` 
and a local version of the site will be live at http://localhost:3000.

This repository also contains a working example of how Spotify's PKCE authorization 
process can be used to authorize a user.
